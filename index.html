			<h3>Sunnah IT Institute</h3>
			<h4>2017-2018</h4>
		 <p>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is one of the most lucrative subjects among the engineering disciplines of the world right now. The subject became the first choice rapidly for many high-school graduates who wanted a career in computational technology. Seemingly, one might think that this discipline deals with computation primarily. Nevertheless, the field of CSE is a widely diversified one; it is ever-changing. The subject has been expanding since its inception as a separate subject to study at universities.
How is it to graduate from this field and have a career? Moreover, is the quality of studying CSE in Bangladesh only limited to the public universities offering a degree in CSE? Not so!
East West University (EWU), Dhaka, started its journey as a private university in Bangladesh in 1996. Here are three EWU graduates majoring in CSE who have shared their insights on the subject and career.
Perception of a software engineer: Sabit Faisal Dipto is currently working as a software engineer at Human Resocia, a Japanese platform that welcomes engineers from more than 30 countries. He has managed to pull off his software engineering skills and is now enjoying the privileges of an international career. How did he do that?
"Programming," he answered. Programming skills are necessary. He went on to explain more. Problem-solving, self-motivation and adaptability are the qualities that any successful software engineer requires. </p> <br>
 
 <h3>Daffodil International Professional Training Institute</h3>
 <h4>2019-2021</h4>
 <p>The study recommended that the quality of CSE/IIT programmes require significant revision by introducing more hands on practice in curriculums. Students said that lessons were mostly theoretical. Up-to-date practical skills also needed to be regularly updated. 

It said soft skills needed to be designed or integrated in the curriculum and pedagogy to strengthen problem solving and communication skills. 

University infrastructure and faculty need to be developed to meet the industry’s growing demand. Additional hard infrastructure, such as computer laboratories and data centers, were also needed to expand access to quality CSE/ IIT higher education programmes. </p>
